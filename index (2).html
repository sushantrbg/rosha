    <p style="font-size:20px;color: white">So I am whoever i am but Rosha you knows who made this. So imma just talk to her bc idc what y'all say i made this for her. Whenever you feel low or you're down always remember that kid whose laptop was broken, he learnt html coding that also a computers job doing it on a phone, everything from basics he learnt, spent to much time and made this just too say that you're really special to him. Doing this was not easy you know for dumb people like me but i really wanted to do something for you. So maile sike ka bata huncha kasari huncha mobile ma kasari garna everything and here it is. I really love you and you're really special. </p>
